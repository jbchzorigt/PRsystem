# PRsystem — Phase Status

**Branch:** `claude/mvp-implementation`
**Base commit:** `c1c2abc` (`docs: add hotel booking MVP requirements baseline`)
**Phase namespace:** 01–23 as fixed in [build-plan.md](build-plan.md) §3. Approved and immutable —
no phase may be dropped, merged, renumbered or reordered.

Legend: `DONE` · `IN PROGRESS` · `BLOCKED` · `NOT STARTED`

## Current position

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Current phase | **00 — Requirement intake and governance baseline** |
| Phase state | `DONE` (repaired; awaiting customer acceptance) |
| Next phase | 01 — Architecture and threat model |
| Next phase state | `NOT STARTED` — requires explicit authorization to begin |
| Blocking conflicts | None. Four documented drift resolutions, zero unresolved P0 conflicts. |

## Phase 00 record

### Scope completed

- **Pre-flight.** The worktree was empty and not a git repository. Initialized from
  `https://github.com/jbchzorigt/PRsystem.git`; `main` verified clean at `c1c2abc`; branched to
  `claude/mvp-implementation`. No tracked file was modified at any point.
- **Requirement intake.** All 27 files [docs/00-mvp-open-decisions.md](../00-mvp-open-decisions.md) …
  [docs/26-room-minibar-lifecycle.md](../26-room-minibar-lifecycle.md) read completely — 10 212 lines.
  Seven files exceeded the single-read cap and were read across multiple paginated reads: `02`, `05`,
  `09`, `13`, `18`, `22`, `26`.
- Created [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) with the permanent engineering rules.
- Created the five implementation-governance documents under `docs/implementation/`.
- Inventoried **279 canonical DEC IDs** across 22 decision families.
- Inventoried **11 external integration gates** (EXT-01 … EXT-11) plus three production security
  exceptions carried by the Police module.
- Recorded **17 P1 configuration items** and **four documentation drift resolutions**.

### Repair applied after review

The first submission drifted from the approved plan: it contained 21 phases and altered the approved
ordering. The repair restored the approved structure without touching any requirement document.

- Restored the exact approved 23-phase structure, numbering and titles (01–23).
- Phase 01 is now architecture and threat-model documentation only; Phase 02 is the monorepo
  scaffold; Phase 03 is the platform kernel.
- Full external adapters moved to Phase 20. Earlier phases may define typed provider ports and
  deterministic simulators only where the phase cannot be built or gated without them; the permitted
  set is enumerated in [build-plan.md](build-plan.md) §2.
- All 279 DEC mappings preserved and reassigned so that **each decision has exactly one owning
  phase**. Consumption by a later phase is expressed as a sequencing constraint, not a second owner.
- Added `tools/validate-governance.mjs` and made governance validation a standing gate.

### Changed file groups

| Commit | Files |
| --- | --- |
| `07a9fd0` | `CLAUDE.md`; `docs/implementation/` (five documents, new) |
| repair | `docs/implementation/build-plan.md`, `phase-status.md`, `requirements-traceability.md`, `external-integration-gates.md`, `assumptions-and-conflicts.md`; `tools/validate-governance.mjs` (new) |

### Migrations

None.

### DEC coverage

Inventory only. All 279 decisions are `PENDING` with exactly one owning phase in 01–23. Phase load is
tabulated in [requirements-traceability.md](requirements-traceability.md) §2.

### Test gates

Phase 00 is a documentation phase; no application gate exists yet, and none is claimed as passing.
The governance gate was executed:

```bash
node tools/validate-governance.mjs
git diff --check
git status --porcelain
```

Results are recorded in the repair commit message and reported to the customer.

### Security and concurrency evidence

Not applicable to a documentation phase.

### Remaining blockers

- No P0 product blockers. [docs/00-mvp-open-decisions.md](../00-mvp-open-decisions.md) §2 records
  zero open P0 items.
- Eleven EXT gates block production release only. Development proceeds against typed ports plus
  deterministic simulators with production adapters disabled until Phase 20 (CLAUDE.md §9).
- Seventeen P1 items are configuration and acceptance values that do not reopen schema or API design;
  each has a documented interim default in
  [assumptions-and-conflicts.md](assumptions-and-conflicts.md) §4.

### Commits

- `07a9fd0835893c0c9e3d11777f51f4dbd580cdb9` — initial Phase 00 baseline.
- Repair commit SHA recorded at commit time.

## Update protocol

At the end of every phase, append to the phase ledger:

1. State transition and date.
2. Migration file names added.
3. Exact gate commands executed with pass and fail counts, including
   `node tools/validate-governance.mjs`.
4. Commit SHA.

Never mark a phase `DONE` on the strength of a command that was not run.

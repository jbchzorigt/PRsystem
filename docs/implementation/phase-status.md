## Phase 00 record

### Scope completed

- **Pre-flight.** The worktree was empty and not a git repository. Initialized from
  `https://github.com/jbchzorigt/PRsystem.git`; `main` verified clean at `c1c2abc`; branched to
  `claude/mvp-implementation`. No tracked file was modified at any point.
- **Requirement intake.** All 27 files [docs/00-mvp-open-decisions.md](../00-mvp-open-decisions.md) …
  [docs/26-room-minibar-lifecycle.md](../26-room-minibar-lifecycle.md) read completely — 10 212 lines.
  Seven files exceeded the single-read cap and were read across multiple paginated reads: `02`, `05`,
  `09`, `13`, `18`, `22`, `26`.
- Created [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) with the permanent engineering rules.
- Created the five implementation-governance documents under `docs/implementation/`.
- Inventoried **279 canonical DEC IDs** across 22 decision families.
- Inventoried **11 external integration gates** (EXT-01 … EXT-11) plus three production security
  exceptions carried by the Police module.
- Recorded **17 P1 configuration items** and **four documentation drift resolutions**.

### Repair applied after review

The first submission drifted from the approved plan: it contained 21 phases and altered the approved
ordering. The repair restored the approved structure without touching any requirement document.

- Restored the exact approved 23-phase structure, numbering and titles (01–23).
- Phase 01 is now architecture and threat-model documentation only; Phase 02 is the monorepo
  scaffold; Phase 03 is the platform kernel.
- Full external adapters moved to Phase 20. Earlier phases may define typed provider ports and
  deterministic simulators only where the phase cannot be built or gated without them; the permitted
  set is enumerated in [build-plan.md](build-plan.md) §2.
- All 279 DEC mappings preserved and reassigned so that **each decision has exactly one owning
  phase**. Consumption by a later phase is expressed as a sequencing constraint, not a second owner.
- Added `tools/validate-governance.mjs` and made governance validation a standing gate.

### Changed file groups

| Commit | Files |
| --- | --- |
| `07a9fd0` | `CLAUDE.md`; `docs/implementation/` (five documents, new) |
| repair | `docs/implementation/build-plan.md`, `phase-status.md`, `requirements-traceability.md`, `external-integration-gates.md`, `assumptions-and-conflicts.md`; `tools/validate-governance.mjs` (new) |

### Migrations

None.

### DEC coverage

Inventory only. All 279 decisions are `PENDING` with exactly one owning phase in 01–23. Phase load is
tabulated in [requirements-traceability.md](requirements-traceability.md) §2.

### Test gates

Phase 00 is a documentation phase; no application gate exists yet, and none is claimed as passing.
The governance gate was executed:

```bash
node tools/validate-governance.mjs
git diff --check
git status --porcelain
```

Results are recorded in the repair commit message and reported to the customer.

### Security and concurrency evidence

Not applicable to a documentation phase.

### Remaining blockers

- No P0 product blockers. [docs/00-mvp-open-decisions.md](../00-mvp-open-decisions.md) §2 records
  zero open P0 items.
- Eleven EXT gates block production release only. Development proceeds against typed ports plus
  deterministic simulators with production adapters disabled until Phase 20 (CLAUDE.md §9).
- Seventeen P1 items are configuration and acceptance values that do not reopen schema or API design;
  each has a documented interim default in
  [assumptions-and-conflicts.md](assumptions-and-conflicts.md) §4.

### Commits

- `07a9fd0835893c0c9e3d11777f51f4dbd580cdb9` — initial Phase 00 baseline.
- Repair commit SHA recorded at commit time.

## Phase 01 record

### Scope completed

Documentation only. No workspace, package manifest, lockfile, dependency, application code, migration
or test code was created, and `docs/00` … `docs/26` were not modified.

Delivered under [docs/architecture/](../architecture/README.md):

| Deliverable | Document |
| --- | --- |
| System context (C4 L1), actors, boundary crossings, three separated money flows | `01-system-context.md` |
| Container and deployment view, request and callback lifecycles, worker queues | `02-container-and-deployment.md` |
| Module ownership register (19 modules), dependency rules, cross-module flows | `03-module-ownership-and-dependencies.md` |
| Logical ERD per bounded context with database-level invariants | `04-logical-data-model.md` |

| 20 architecture decision records | `adr/ADR-0001` … `adr/ADR-0020` |

`tools/validate-governance.mjs` extended with Phase 01 architecture checks 8–13, and check 7 widened
to cover the architecture set.

### Design decisions closed on review

The customer required the four open design questions to be closed before Phase 02. All four are now
resolved; **none remains open**.

| ID | Decision | ADR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DM-01 | PostgreSQL Row Level Security as defence in depth — forced RLS, transaction-scoped server-derived context, five database roles, separate migration owner, Police schema and role, explicit public/global/cross-tenant handling, required RLS tests in owning phases | [ADR-0017](../architecture/adr/ADR-0017-tenant-isolation-rls.md) |
| DM-02 | Monthly-partitioned append-only audit in two separately granted streams, pre-created partitions with a horizon alert, fail-closed high-risk audit, retention by data class with legal hold and no invented Police duration, no `UPDATE`/`DELETE` for runtime roles | [ADR-0018](../architecture/adr/ADR-0018-audit-partitioning.md) |
| DM-03 | Same-transaction read models within a module; cross-module projections eventually consistent via outbox and idempotent inbox with observable freshness; critical commands never read a projection; all projections rebuildable | [ADR-0019](../architecture/adr/ADR-0019-projection-consistency.md) |
| DM-04 | Provider-neutral `KeyManagementPort`, envelope encryption with versioned DEKs, separate Hotel/Guest and Police key scopes, versioned keyed-HMAC lookup, key version stored with ciphertext, rotation and rewrapping, development simulator, production fails closed, no plaintext key anywhere | [ADR-0020](../architecture/adr/ADR-0020-key-management.md) |

Four controls were added to carry them: `CTL-DATA-11` (RLS), `CTL-DATA-12` (partitioned fail-closed
audit), `CTL-BOUND-03` (projection critical-path isolation) and `CTL-SEC-04` (key management). The
first three are universal and apply to every command.

### Non-functional status correction

The first Phase 01 submission claimed P1-10 was closed. That was wrong: architecture may **propose**
measurable targets, but only an approved customer decision makes them a product requirement.

- Every value in `15-non-functional-targets.md` now carries the status
  `PROVISIONAL_ARCHITECTURE_DEFAULT`, explicitly including **RPO ≤ 5 minutes** and **RTO ≤ 4 hours**.
- **P1-10 status: `OPEN`.** P1 accounting is **17 total · 17 pending · 0 closed**, consistent across
  every governance document and enforced by `GATE-GOV` check 13.
- Phase 22 measures the values; Phase 23 reports achieved-or-not per target and returns the release
  decision to the customer. Measurement alone never closes the item.

### Changed file groups

- `docs/architecture/` — 18 new documents plus `adr/` (17 new files)
- `docs/implementation/requirements-traceability.md` — §26 control mapping, §27 validation
- `docs/implementation/phase-status.md` — this record
- `tools/validate-governance.mjs` — checks 7–11

### Migrations

None. No schema exists.

### DEC coverage

Phase 01 owns **0 decisions**. It establishes the control and gate vocabulary that all 279 decisions
are mapped through; every decision now has a control and gate mapping, verified by check 11.
No decision moves to `COVERED` in this phase.

### Test gates

```bash
node tools/validate-governance.mjs      # GATE-GOV — 13/13 passed
git diff --check                        # clean, exit 0
```

`GATE-TYPES`, `GATE-LINT`, `GATE-UNIT`, `GATE-INTEG`, `GATE-CONC`, `GATE-MIGR`, `GATE-E2E` and
`GATE-SEC` are **not applicable**: no code, no schema and no workspace exist until Phase 02. None was
run and none is claimed as passing.

### Security and concurrency evidence

Design-level only. The threat model records 83 threats with named mitigations, controls and verifying
gates, and a residual register of 15 Medium risks with named owners. No Critical or High residual risk
remains. Concurrency evidence is the 21-entry race register, each entry bound to a `GATE-CONC` test to
be written by its owning phase.

### Remaining blockers

No P0 product blockers. Eleven EXT gates block production release only. **Seventeen P1 items remain
open**, including P1-10. The four Phase 01 design questions `DM-01` … `DM-04` are **closed** by
ADR-0017 … ADR-0020; none remains open.

---

## Update protocol

At the end of every phase, append to the phase ledger:

1. State transition and date.
2. Migration file names added.
3. Exact gate commands executed with pass and fail counts, including
   `node tools/validate-governance.mjs`.
4. Commit SHA.

Never mark a phase `DONE` on the strength of a command that was not run.
